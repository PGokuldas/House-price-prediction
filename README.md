# House-price-prediction
This project is a machine learning-based solution to predict house prices using historical housing data. Built with Python and scikit-learn, it uses a Linear Regression model trained on multiple features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, year built, condition, garage availability, and location.
